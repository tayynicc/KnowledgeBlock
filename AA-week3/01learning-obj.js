Describe the difference between asynchronous and synchronous code
Execute the asynchronous function setTimeout with a callback.
Given the function "function asyncy(cb) { setTimeout(cb, 1000); console.log("async") }" and the function "function callback() { console.log("callback"); }", predict the output of "asyncy(callback);"
Use setInterval to have a function execute 10 times with a 1 second period. After the 10th cycle, clear the interval.
