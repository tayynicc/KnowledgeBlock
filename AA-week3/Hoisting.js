// a var declared variable will have its name hoisted to he top of its scope and the value set to undefined 
    // calling on it will usually result in a type erroe 

    // a function initalized wiht function decleration syntax is hoisted in memory and avaliable in the above scope. 

// trying to invoke a funciotn that is declared wiht let before it has been delcared will result in a refrence error 

// attempting to define a let declared variable and a fucntion decleration witht eh same name in the same scope will throw a refrence error because the name cannot be declared twice. 


// trying to invoke a let declared var before initalized : refrence error 
// invoking var declared variable before init: type error (not a function) because value set to undefined.
