Given a recursive function, identify what is the base case and the recursive case.
Identify and use default parameters for functions.
Define what a "stack overflow" means in JavaScript's call stack.
Identify what causes the error - RangeError: Maximum call stack.
Map out the recursive call stack when running a test case through a recursion function.
Solve problems using recursion.
Given a buggy recursive function, debug the function.


//what recursion is and how to identify it,

// the process of calling a function FROM WITHIN itself.
//If we have to gently unpack each crate but we don't know the contents, we'll have to go one-by-one through each crate, 
//pulling items out individually. 

//Understanding recursion means understanding the two cases, or expected output for a particular input, in a recursive function. 
//These are known as the base case and recursive case.


// usually you want to itterate because itteration has a smaller time complexity 




// base case 
    // tells us when to stop 


// recursive step  
    // brings us closer to the base case 
    // condtion where you keep doing what you doing till the abse case is meet 













implementing recursive functions,
and breaking complex problems down into simpler tasks

// missing base case or recursive step is not walking to the base case
