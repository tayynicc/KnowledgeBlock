// MDN
//Spread syntax (...) allows an iterable such as an array expression or string to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls)
//or elements (for array literals) are expected, or an object expression to be expanded in places where zero or more key-value pairs (for object literals) are expected.
