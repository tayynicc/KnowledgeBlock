Identify the three keywords used to declare a variable in JavaScript
Explain the differences between const, let and var
Identify the difference between function and block-scoped variables
Paraphrase the concept of hoisting in regards to function and block-scoped variables

//A variable always evaluates to the value it contains no matter how you declare it.


// let
    //any variables declared with the keyword let allows you to reassign that variable.
    //Variable declared using let is scoped within a block.
//const
    //any variables declared with the keyword const will not allow you to reassign that variable.
    // Variable declared using const is scoped within a block
// var
    //A var declared variable may or may not be reassigned, and the variable is scoped to a function.
